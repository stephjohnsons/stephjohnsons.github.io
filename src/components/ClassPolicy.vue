    <h4>
      Policy Requirements
    </h4>
    <p>Students enrolled under this studio must complete the minimum lesson hours required by the Institute:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Major: 13 hours per semester / 6 hours (short semester)</li>
      <li> Minor: 6 hours 30 minutes / 3 hours 15 minutes (short semester)</li>
    </ul>
    At the end of each long semester, major students must sit for a jury examination. Students are expected to prepare

    music office (Mr. Michael Ng).</p>

  <h4>
    Objective
  </h4>
  <p>
    The primary objective of this class is to develop a comprehensive understanding of cello technique and its effective
    application in practice. Students will learn to analyze their own playing, identify technical challenges, and
    develop practical solutions to overcome them. <br /><br />
    The course aims to prepare students for professional musical careers and/or the standards required for admission
    into graduate-level programs.
  </p>

  <h4>
    Content and Materials
  </h4>
  <p>Students will study core fundamentals, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical studies and scales (including arpeggios and double stops)</li>
    <li>Standard repertoire from all historical periods</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Particular emphasis will be placed on:
  <ul>
    <li>Musicianship and stylistic awareness</li>
    <li>Tone production and timbre</li>
    <li>Accuracy and sensitivity in rhythm and intonation</li>
    <li>Technical development</li>
    <li>Relaxed, tension-free playing to reduce risk of injury</li>
  </ul>

  Students are expected to purchase required printed sheet music. Photocopies are permitted for in-class use only and
  are not allowed for jury examinations. The average annual cost of required music should not exceed RM700, depending on
  repertoire. Books may be ordered through the instructor at the beginning of each semester.
  </p>

  <h4>
    Attendance
  </h4>
  <p>Attendance at individual lessons is mandatory, and punctuality is expected. Students may be required to perform in
    studio classes or attend studio ensemble sessions depending on studio size each semester.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cancellations must be communicated at least 24 hours before the scheduled lesson time. Short-notice cancellations
    will be considered unexcused absences unless due to an emergency and will not be made up. If the instructor cancels
    a lesson, a make-up lesson will be arranged. Students must contact the instructor to schedule make-up lessons for
    excused absences. No-shows will not be replaced.

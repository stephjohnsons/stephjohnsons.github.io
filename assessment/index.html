                  For the assessment, I initially attempted to solve it by creating 1 database  
                  with the two given tables using SQLite. I used Docker as my container
                  and Laravel as my PHP framework, but I came across few issues: 
                  <ol>
                     <li> 
                        While I was able to launch my files on a local server by referring to
                        a step by step tutorial, I came to realise that I <strong>do not fully understand
                        the concept</strong> of how would it work if I were to embed the entire 
                        folder onto my domain. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        While I understood and used the SQL statements effectively, the statements
                        were saved in a separate file, and my initial database already shows 
                        the results from the statements that I had used before, rather than a 
                        "triggered event" each time the HTML page boots up. 
                     </li>
                  </ol>
               </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mt-3 pt-3" id="solution">
               <h2> (Temporary...) Solution </h2>
               <p>
                  Seeing that time was running out and the challenges prevailed after much digging 
                  across the internet, I decided to use the languages that I am more familiar with: 
                  HTML and JavaScript. The following steps was what I did:<br />
                  <ol>
                     <li>I first converted the data in Table 1 and Table 2 into a JSON file, <span class="font-monospace bg-dark p-1 rounded-3 border">database.json</span>.</li>
                     <li>Next, I created the skeletal structure in <span class="font-monospace bg-dark p-1 rounded-3 border">index.html</span>.</li>
                     <li>Then, I created a JavaScript file, <span class="font-monospace bg-dark p-1 rounded-3 border">table1-script.js</span>, to ensure that the script fetches the data from Table 1 of the JSON file I created in step 1. Then, a following script that creates a row of data for each unique IndexNo.</li>
                     <li><span class="font-monospace bg-dark p-1 rounded-3 border">table2-script.js</span> was the next thing I created. For this, I had to make sure to "query" the values of index of Table 1, then ensure that the calculations could be done on trigger. I also created a button next to the header 
                     so that the calculation is done by clicking on the button. (Not exactly SQL, I know...) Lastly, was to create a row of data for Alpha, Beta, and Charlie.</li>
                     <li>One last code: disabling the button after the calculation is done, or else the table keeps getting repeated entries of Alpha, Beta, and Charlie.</li>
                     <li>Then, I added Bootstrap with some extra tingling (<span class="font-monospace bg-dark p-1 rounded-3 border">styles.css</span>) into this HTML so we don't bleed our eyes while looking at it.</li>
                  </ol>
               </p>

                  I am aware that this solution may not be what is requested nor expected, but 
                  I am grateful that I was given the opportunity to practically learn more about 
                  software- and backend development as a whole. I also realised that I should stick 
                  to frontend development... But, thank you, for taking the time to consider 
                  my application and for reading this.

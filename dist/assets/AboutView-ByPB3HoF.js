Growing up in a trilingual and multicultural environment gave me first-hand experience in understanding how different aspects of society come together to achieve a common goal. Then, as I grew older, I slowly understood that all art reflects the state of our society, culture, and aesthetic values. This philosophy is something that I value and share with others in my performances and teachings. I was formally trained back home in Malaysia but was exposed to the international music scene when I was 16. For the years following, I would travel to international stages across Europe, Asia, and the U.S. All these opportunities enabled awareness and answers to my longstanding social identity-related questions. With my additional training with various teachers, I have also learnt to think outside of the box as a classical musician and teacher. My work focuses on magnifying the integration of music and society and communicating art comprehensibly and responsibly to my audiences. <br data-v-429ce735><br data-v-429ce735><strong data-v-429ce735>Mission</strong><br data-v-429ce735> I curate musical performances that reflects and resonates with people. Art should be relatable and sustainable. And with that, I currently design projects with constructive strategies for developing audiences, designing concerts, and educating the next generation of artists. <br data-v-429ce735><br data-v-429ce735><strong data-v-429ce735>Vision | Goals</strong><br data-v-429ce735> I aim to create performances with more social relevance that would alter the stereotype of elitism in classical music. As this task is far too great for one person&#39;s ability, I wish to educate and gather an artistic hive-mind with the same desire, and then continuously generate creative sparks through our artistic interactions. </p><p class="fs-7 text-muted" data-v-429ce735>Last edited Oct 2022.
